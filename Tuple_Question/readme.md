# Python Tuple Hashing üêç

This repository contains a simple Python code hacker rank question that demonstrates how to create a tuple, calculate its hash value, and print the result. The code snippet uses the `hash()` function to compute the hash value of a tuple containing two integers.
In hacker rank select pypy3 only to run as there is some issue in python3 for this code, if there is any particular reason you know let me know also.
# Question 
# Task
Given an integer,n, and n space-separated integers as input, create a tuple, , of those  integers. Then compute and print the result of hash(t).

Note: hash() is one of the functions in the __builtins__ module, so it need not be imported.

# Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of elements in the tuple.
The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the elements in tuple .

# Output Format

Print the result of hash(t).

most of the solution are not exact as they didnot use of given integer n which will limit the useras it auto select the given n integers only 


## Code Snippet üìùüîç

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())  # Read the number of elements in the tuple
    t = tuple(map(int, input().split()[:2]))  # Read two space-separated integers and create a tuple
    print(hash(t))  # Calculate and print the hash value of the tuple


```
After running the script, the hash value of the tuple will be calculated and displayed.
The provided Python code snippet reads the number of elements in the tuple and then reads two space-separated integers to create a tuple. The hash value of the tuple is then calculated using the `hash()` function and printed to the console.
