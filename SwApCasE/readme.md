# String Case Swapper 🔀🔠

The `swap_case` function is a Python function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where the case of each character is swapped: uppercase letters are converted to lowercase, and lowercase letters are converted to uppercase. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged. 💼

# Question
You are given a string and your task is to swap cases. In other words, convert all lowercase letters to uppercase letters and vice versa.

## Function Signature 📝

```python
def swap_case(s):
    """
    Swap the case of characters in a given string.

    Parameters:
    s (str): The input string.

    Returns:
    str: The string with swapped character cases.
   
```

Alternatively, you can use Python's built-in str.swapcase() method to achieve the same result:

```python

input_string = "Hello World!"
output_string = input_string.swapcase()
print(output_string)  # Output: "hELLO wORLD!"

```
